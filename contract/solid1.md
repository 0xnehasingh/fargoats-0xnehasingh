To restructure and extend the architecture to support the given application and schema map, we need to ensure that the architecture aligns with the database schema and supports the necessary operations. Here's a high-level outline of how the architecture can be structured:

### 1. Core Domain Entities

These entities represent the main objects in the system and map closely to the database tables.

```typescript
// Core Domain Entities

class Profile {
    id: UUID;
    email: string;
    walletAddress: string;
    uniqueName: string;
    // ... other profile fields

    async createSession(): Promise<UserSession>
    async validateTwoFactor(code: string): Promise<boolean>
    async updateProfile(data: ProfileUpdateDTO): Promise<void>
    async getAnalytics(): Promise<UserAnalytics>
}

class Project {
    id: UUID;
    founderId: UUID;
    rfpId?: UUID;
    title: string;
    status: ProjectStatus;
    // ... other project fields

    async createQuest(data: QuestCreateDTO): Promise<Quest>
    async updateMetrics(): Promise<void>
    async getAnalytics(): Promise<ProjectAnalytics>
}

class Quest {
    id: UUID;
    projectId: UUID;
    templateId?: UUID;
    title: string;
    requirements: QuestRequirements;
    // ... other quest fields

    async participate(userId: UUID): Promise<QuestParticipant>
    async validateCompletion(participantId: UUID): Promise<boolean>
    async distributeRewards(): Promise<void>
}

class SmartContract {
    id: UUID;
    founderAddress: string;
    contractAddress: string;
    // ... other contract fields

    async configureEvents(configs: EventConfigDTO[]): Promise<void>
    async allocatePoints(amount: number): Promise<void>
    async distributeRewards(): Promise<void>
}
```

### 2. Service Layer

The service layer handles business logic and interacts with the domain entities and repositories.

```typescript
// Service Layer

class AuthenticationService {
    async login(credentials: LoginDTO): Promise<Session>
    async verify2FA(userId: UUID, code: string): Promise<boolean>
    async refreshToken(token: string): Promise<Session>
    async validateSession(sessionId: UUID): Promise<boolean>
}

class ProjectService {
    async createProject(data: ProjectCreateDTO): Promise<Project>
    async verifyProject(projectId: UUID): Promise<void>
    async updateProjectMetrics(projectId: UUID): Promise<void>
    async getProjectAnalytics(projectId: UUID): Promise<ProjectAnalytics>
}

class QuestService {
    async createQuest(data: QuestCreateDTO): Promise<Quest>
    async participateInQuest(questId: UUID, userId: UUID): Promise<void>
    async validateQuestCompletion(participationId: UUID): Promise<void>
    async distributeQuestRewards(questId: UUID): Promise<void>
}

class SmartContractService {
    async registerContract(data: ContractRegistrationDTO): Promise<SmartContract>
    async processContractEvent(event: ContractEvent): Promise<void>
    async allocatePoints(contractId: UUID, amount: number): Promise<void>
    async distributeRewards(contractId: UUID): Promise<void>
}
```

### 3. Repository Layer

The repository layer abstracts the data access logic and interacts with the database.

```typescript
// Repository Layer

interface IProfileRepository {
    findById(id: UUID): Promise<Profile>
    findByWalletAddress(address: string): Promise<Profile>
    create(data: ProfileCreateDTO): Promise<Profile>
    update(id: UUID, data: ProfileUpdateDTO): Promise<void>
}

interface IProjectRepository {
    findById(id: UUID): Promise<Project>
    findByFounder(founderId: UUID): Promise<Project[]>
    create(data: ProjectCreateDTO): Promise<Project>
    updateMetrics(id: UUID, metrics: ProjectMetrics): Promise<void>
}

interface IQuestRepository {
    findById(id: UUID): Promise<Quest>
    findByProject(projectId: UUID): Promise<Quest[]>
    create(data: QuestCreateDTO): Promise<Quest>
    updateStatus(id: UUID, status: QuestStatus): Promise<void>
}

interface ISmartContractRepository {
    findByAddress(address: string): Promise<SmartContract>
    findByFounder(founderAddress: string): Promise<SmartContract[]>
    create(data: ContractCreateDTO): Promise<SmartContract>
    updatePoints(id: UUID, points: number): Promise<void>
}
```

### 4. Event System

The event system handles asynchronous communication and event-driven architecture.

```typescript
// Event System

class EventBus {
    async publish(event: ApplicationEvent): Promise<void>
    async subscribe(eventType: string, handler: EventHandler): Promise<void>
}

interface ApplicationEvent {
    type: string;
    payload: any;
    timestamp: Date;
}
```

### 5. Middleware and Validators

Middleware and validators ensure data integrity and security.

```typescript
// Middleware and Validators

class AuthenticationMiddleware {
    async validateSession(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction): Promise<void>
    async validate2FA(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction): Promise<void>
}

class ValidationMiddleware {
    async validateProjectCreation(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction): Promise<void>
    async validateQuestRequirements(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction): Promise<void>
}
```

### 6. Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)

DTOs are used to transfer data between layers.

```typescript
// Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)

interface ProfileCreateDTO {
    email: string;
    walletAddress: string;
    uniqueName: string;
}

interface ProjectCreateDTO {
    title: string;
    description: string;
    founderId: UUID;
    category: string;
}

interface QuestCreateDTO {
    projectId: UUID;
    title: string;
    requirements: QuestRequirements;
    rewards: QuestRewards;
}

interface ContractRegistrationDTO {
    address: string;
    founderAddress: string;
    name: string;
    abi: string;
}
```

### 7. Analytics and Metrics

Analytics and metrics services provide insights and reporting.

```typescript
// Analytics and Metrics

class AnalyticsService {
    async trackUserActivity(userId: UUID, activity: ActivityType): Promise<void>
    async trackProjectMetrics(projectId: UUID): Promise<void>
    async generateReports(): Promise<AnalyticsReport>
}
```

### 8. Background Jobs

Background jobs handle scheduled tasks and long-running processes.

```typescript
// Background Jobs

class JobScheduler {
    async scheduleMetricsUpdate(): Promise<void>
    async scheduleRewardsDistribution(): Promise<void>
    async scheduleContractVerification(): Promise<void>
}
```

### Integration with Database Schema

- **Profiles**: Managed by `Profile` class and `IProfileRepository`.
- **Projects**: Managed by `Project` class and `IProjectRepository`.
- **Quests**: Managed by `Quest` class and `IQuestRepository`.
- **Smart Contracts**: Managed by `SmartContract` class and `ISmartContractRepository`.
- **User Sessions, Roles, and Two-Factor**: Handled by `AuthenticationService` and related middleware.
- **Rewards and Points**: Managed by `SmartContractService` and related classes.
- **Analytics and Metrics**: Handled by `AnalyticsService`.
- **Background Jobs**: Scheduled by `JobScheduler`.

This architecture ensures a clean separation of concerns, aligns with the database schema, and supports the necessary operations for the application. Let me know if you need further details on any specific part!

# Schema Explanation

## 1. Core Data Structures

### Founder Struct
```solidity
struct Founder {
    address[] contracts;        // Array of contract addresses owned by founder
    uint256 allocatedPoints;    // Total points allocated to founder
    uint256 distributedPoints;  // Points distributed to contracts
    uint256 earnedRewards;     // Total rewards earned
    bytes32 apiKey;            // Unique API key for external integrations
    bool isActive;             // Founder's active status
    string founderName;        // Founder's identifier/name
}
```

**Purpose**:
- Tracks a founder's portfolio and activity
- Manages points and rewards accounting
- Handles authentication via API key
- Maintains founder's operational status

### ContractInfo Struct
```solidity
struct ContractInfo {
    string name;               // Contract identifier
    address contractAddress;   // Ethereum address of the contract
    bytes32 abiHash;          // Hash of contract ABI for verification
    uint256 currentPoints;    // Current point balance
    uint256 pendingRewards;   // Unconverted/unclaimed rewards
    uint256 claimedRewards;   // Total rewards claimed
    string category;          // Contract classification
    bool isVerified;         // Verification status
}
```

**Purpose**:
- Stores contract metadata
- Tracks points and rewards at contract level
- Manages verification status
- Categorizes contracts for organization

## 2. State Management

### Core Storage Variables
```solidity
// Set of all API keys in the system
EnumerableSet.Bytes32Set private allApiKeys;

// Set of active founder addresses
EnumerableSet.AddressSet private activeFounders;

// Mapping of categories to contract addresses
mapping(string => EnumerableSet.AddressSet) private categoryContracts;
```

### Implied Mappings (not shown but necessary)
```solidity
// Founder storage
mapping(address => Founder) private founders;

// Contract storage
mapping(address => ContractInfo) private contracts;

// API key to founder address lookup
mapping(bytes32 => address) private apiKeyToFounder;
```

## 3. Relationships and Data Flow

```plaintext
                                    ┌─────────────────┐
                                    │     Founder     │
                                    └────────┬────────┘
                                            │
                                            │ 1:N
                                            ▼
                                    ┌─────────────────┐
                                    │   ContractInfo  │
                                    └────────┬────────┘
                                            │
                                            │ N:1
                                            ▼
                                    ┌─────────────────┐
                                    │    Category     │
                                    └─────────────────┘
```

### Key Relationships:
1. **Founder to Contracts** (1:N)
   - One founder can own multiple contracts
   - Each contract belongs to one founder
   - Tracked via `Founder.contracts` array

2. **Contract to Category** (N:1)
   - Each contract belongs to one category
   - Categories can have multiple contracts
   - Managed via `categoryContracts` mapping

3. **API Keys to Founders** (1:1)
   - Each founder has one unique API key
   - Each API key maps to one founder
   - Bidirectional lookup via `allApiKeys` and `apiKeyToFounder`

## 4. Points and Rewards System

### Flow of Points:
```plaintext
Allocation → Distribution → Conversion → Claims

1. allocatedPoints (Founder)
   └─► distributedPoints (Founder)
       └─► currentPoints (Contract)
           └─► pendingRewards (Contract)
               └─► claimedRewards (Contract)
```

### Accounting Rules:
- `allocatedPoints ≥ distributedPoints` (Founder level)
- `currentPoints` converts to `pendingRewards` using `REWARDS_CONVERSION_RATE`
- `claimedRewards` tracks total rewards extracted from system

## 5. Constraints and Validations

```solidity
// System Constants
MAX_CONTRACTS_PER_FOUNDER   // Limits contracts per founder
REWARDS_CONVERSION_RATE     // Points to rewards conversion rate

// Key Validations
- Unique API keys
- Active founder status for operations
- Contract ownership verification
- Points/rewards sufficiency checks
- Category validity
```

## 6. Access Patterns

Common queries supported by this schema:
1. Get all contracts for a founder
2. Look up founder by API key
3. Get all contracts in a category
4. Check points/rewards status
5. Verify contract ownership
6. Track total system statistics

This schema design prioritizes:
- Efficient lookups and relationships
- Clear ownership and access control
- Flexible categorization
- Accurate accounting
- Scalable data management

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the schema or explain how certain operations work within this structure?
